# WUR Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge EDA
This is a ***project*** built for exploring the generated data, regarding the Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge (Second Edition, 2019) that took place at Wageningen University & Research.

This ***competition*** was about five international teams - consisting of scientists, professionals and students with multi-disciplinary expertise - challenging themselves in order to make a large step towards the *Autonomous Greenhouse*. The teams' names are: The Automators, AICU, IUA.CAAS, Digilog and Automatoes. 

The teams developed their own intelligent algorithms and used them to determine the set points for climate, irrigation and a number of cultivation-related parameters and control the production of cherry tomato crop remotely. 

The ***teams objective*** was to maximize net profit, by minimizing use of resources (e.g. water, nutrients, energy -heating and electricity- CO2) while optimizing income as a function of production and fruit quality.

***Data*** were collected during a 6-month cherry tomato production in 6 high-tech glasshouse compartments, located at the Wageningen Research Centre in Bleiswijk (The Netherlands). The dataset contains data on outdoor and indoor greenhouse climate, irrigation, status of actuators, requested and realized climate setpoints, resource consumption, harvest, crop-related parameters, tomato quality, analysis of irrigation and drain samples and root-zone/slab information.

The ***project's objective*** is to describe and analyze the results of the second *“Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”*.

The complete dataset as well as information about the challenge was being taken from the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12764777/2) official website.
