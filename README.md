# WUR Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge EDA
This is a ***project*** built for exploring the generated data, regarding the Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge (Second Edition, 2019) that took place at Wageningen University & Research.

This ***competition*** was about five international teams - consisting of scientists, professionals and students with multi-disciplinary expertise - challenging themselves in order to make a large step towards the *Autonomous Greenhouse*. The teams' names are: The Automators, AICU, IUA.CAAS, Digilog and Automatoes. 

The teams developed their own intelligent algorithms and used them to determine the set points for climate, irrigation and a number of cultivation-related parameters and control the production of cherry tomato crop remotely. 

The ***teams objective*** was to maximize net profit, by minimizing use of resources (e.g. water, nutrients, energy -heating and electricity- CO2) while optimizing income as a function of production and fruit quality.

***Data*** were collected during a 6-month cherry tomato production in 6 high-tech glasshouse compartments, located at the Wageningen Research Centre in Bleiswijk (The Netherlands). The [dataset](Dataset_Compressed.zip) contains data on outdoor and indoor greenhouse climate, irrigation, status of actuators, requested and realized climate setpoints (“Weather” and “GreenhouseClimate”), resource consumption (“Resources”), harvest (“Production”), crop-related parameters (“CropParameters”), tomato quality ("TomQuality”), analysis of irrigation and drain samples (“LabAnalysis”) and root-zone/slab information (“GrodanSens”), (The [Parameters’ description](Parameters’%20description.pdf) can be seen here).

The ***[project](WUR_AutonomousGreenhouse_Project_EDA.ipynb)'s objective*** is to describe and analyze the results of the second *“Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”*.

The complete dataset as well as information about the challenge was being taken from the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12764777/2) official website.
